// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// DeckieAudio: the in-memory audio type (`AudioBuffer`) shared by the decoder and the analysers; no Foundation.
// DeckieCore: Deckie's own ideas (beat grid fit, Camelot, pair scoring, loudness, key, structure), written
// once in plain Swift with no Apple-only framework, so the Apple apps and the Windows and Linux builder share them.
// DeckieLab: reads the lab's feature files (mixer/features/<id>.json, mixer/candidates.json) into DeckieCore types,
// for the parity tests and, later, the Mac benchmark.
// DeckieCrate: the crate file (docs/architecture/crate-format.md): its model, a canonical writer and a checking reader.
// DeckieDecode: audio files to float samples for the analysers: WAV and AIFF in plain Swift; MP3 through dr_mp3
// (CDrMp3) and FLAC through dr_flac (CDrFlac), vendored public-domain C files (DEPENDENCIES.md); AAC is recognised
// and reported as not supported yet, a copy-protected MP4 as protected. It re-exports DeckieAudio.
// CDrMp3, CDrFlac: dr_mp3.h and dr_flac.h compiled as plain C, the same on Linux, Windows and macOS; nothing is
// downloaded at build time.
// COnnxRuntime: ONNX Runtime's C API header (vendored, MIT; DEPENDENCIES.md) and a small C shim that opens the
// library at run time (dlopen, or LoadLibraryExW on Windows), so nothing links it and the package builds without it.
// DeckieInference: ONNX Runtime from Swift (`OnnxRuntime`, `OnnxSession`) and the Beat This! beat tracker
// (`BeatTracker`) on it; the tracker's front end, chunking and peak picking are plain Swift in DeckieCore.
// DeckieTestSupport: synthesised test audio and the beat fixture, shared by the test targets (not a product).
