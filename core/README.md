# core: DeckieCore

Deckie's own ideas, written once in plain Swift with no Apple-only framework, so the Apple apps and the Windows
and Linux crate builder share them. Charter: `docs/architecture/pc-linux-track.md`; running log:
`docs/architecture/pc-linux-status.md`.

- `Sources/DeckieCore`: the beat grid fit (`GridFit.swift`), the Camelot wheel (`Camelot.swift`), tempo
  relations (`TempoMultipliers.swift`), directed pair scoring (`PairScoring.swift`) and the top lists
  (`Recommendations.swift`). Ported line for line from `mixer/analyze.py` and `mixer/score.py`;
  `PythonCompat.swift` holds the rounding and modulo details that keep the numbers identical.
- `Sources/DeckieLab`: reads the lab's `mixer/features/<id>.json` and `mixer/candidates.json` into
  `DeckieCore` types.
- `Tests/DeckieCoreTests`: parity tests against the lab. `Fixtures/` holds the reference numbers, written by
  `Tools/make_fixtures.py` with the lab's own Python (needs numpy; run from the repository root). The tests also
  read `mixer/features/`, `mixer/candidates.json` and `mixer/recs.json` straight from the repository.
